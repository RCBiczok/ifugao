optional optimizations:
* cache tree outputs
* mapping of sets to smaller sets, if a set is rather empty (Mapping)
* Reorganize Unit-Tests in ifugao
* Make errors in input_parser more verbose? (currently, it only says somethign like "could read" or "could not read")
* Parallelisierung (Work-Stealing-Approach)
* Write scipt for compareable benchmark
